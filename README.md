# Overleaf Templates for Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) of the CEITEC PhD School

**Unofficial** LaTeX templates for various documents related to CEITEC's Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC). Made for people who hate that CEITEC forces students to use Microsoft Word.

## Available templates
1) [TAC Thesis Proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/znymrtbrtwdh#a00d71)
2) [TAC Members Proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zhjvrskqjvpp#b7e932)

4) [TAC Assessment Report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hszrkkmcygxp#3fe169)

## How to use

3) Copy the project ([see how](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Copying_a_project#Making_a_copy_of_a_project)).

## Why are the templates shared on GitHub and not in the Overleaf gallery
Because the Overleaf gallery policies are overly restrictive, and updating a template in the gallery to a new version takes days or even weeks.
